  The day has flown by quickly, and I have a headache. I spent the day refactoring the code. Refactoring is not a simple task - there are many things to keep in mind and many things to discover along the way. Now is the time to relax and reread a beautiful book I read many years ago.
  Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino.
